# Blackbox

Repo containing the code for a tutorial series I'm writing while diving into StarkNet and learning Cairo.

Creating an immutable [blackbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_recorder) for cars.

Tutorial text kept on hackmd for easier editing:

* **[Part 1]** 🚧 [Project Setup & Getting Started with Cairo](https://hackmd.io/@sambarnes/BJvGs0JpK)
	* write a unit tested contract in cairo 
	* deploy your contract to testnet
* **[Part 2]** 🐍 [Contract Interaction with starknet.py](https://hackmd.io/@sambarnes/H1Fx7OMaF)
	* create and sign StarkNet transactions from a python application
* **[Part 3]** 🧑 [StarkNet Account Abstraction & Using Standard Contracts](https://hackmd.io/@sambarnes/rkGekNvAY)
	* learn the difference between Ethereum & StarkNet Account models
	* refactor your contract & tests to use standard OpenZeppelin Accounts
